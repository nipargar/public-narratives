# KLIEN Data- Wind Power Potential

## Background

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> In 2024, a total of 9,288 GWh of electrical energy were fed into the grid in Austria by 1,413 wind power plants (WPPs). Because wind power plants have historically been installed according to the state of technological development at the respective time—resulting in substantial differences in performance—the existing fleet in 2024 comprises, excluding small wind turbines, installations with rated capacities ranging from 500 kW to 6,200 kW. For potential analyses, installed capacity therefore represents a more meaningful indicator than the mere number of installations.

## Methodology 
<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The calculation of wind power potentials was carried out in four steps: 

1. <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Identification of potential areas: </b> Potential areas for wind power use were identified by means of a GIS-based analysis. This assessment combined criteria such as terrain slope, minimum distances to settlements, minimum distances to transport and energy infrastructure, and protected natural areas.  

2. <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Placement of hypothetical wind power plants and yield calculation: </b> In a second step, hypothetical wind power plants were placed within the identified potential areas. Based on local wind data from the wind atlas, the energy yield at each turbine location was calculated using an assumed power curve.

3. <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Economic assessment: </b> Subsequently, an economic feasibility analysis was conducted for each modelled turbine location, incorporating remuneration according to the Austrian Renewable Energy Expansion Act (EAG) as well as current investment and operating costs.  

4. <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Allocation of national expansion rates: </b> Finally, nationwide wind power expansion rates—expressed as the number of newly installed wind power plants per year—were modelled and allocated to the individual federal states. The resulting developments were evaluated for the target years 2030 and 2040. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/>More detailed descriptions of the individual steps are provided in the final report of the underlying study or, with respect to the results, in the following sections. 

## Results 

##### Potential Areas for Wind Power Development 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The potential areas for wind power are distributed very unevenly, particularly when considered relative to the total area of each federal state. Site-specific wind conditions are only incorporated into the potential assessment at the stage of the economic feasibility analysis of individual turbine locations. 


<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Due to the required minimum spacing between wind power plants (WPPs), the spatial structure of the potential areas—whether consisting of large contiguous zones or fragmented into many small patches—has a substantial influence on the subsequent calculation of wind power potentials. In the case of highly fragmented potential areas, the land requirement per WPP is only slightly larger than the foundation footprint. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> In contrast, within large contiguous potential areas, each WPP effectively occupies a circular area with a radius of two rotor diameters (half of the assumed minimum inter-turbine spacing of 4D). Consequently, the reported potential areas are not directly proportional to the number of wind power plants, total installed capacity, or annual energy production.

##### Technical Potential of Wind Power 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The technical potential represents the level of wind power utilization that is feasible given the wind resource (i.e. sufficient to enable economically viable operation of a WPP at a given site), technical constraints (e.g. terrain slope), and the assumed minimum distances to settlements and other infrastructure. Constraints related to grid capacity, competing land uses, social acceptance, and demand are not considered. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Repowering areas are included in the technical potential, i.e. areas currently used for wind power that become available again for renewed use after an assumed operational lifetime of 20 years. Over time, currently utilized wind power sites thus gradually re-enter the pool of areas available for wind power deployment. As a result, slightly different technical potentials emerge for the years 2030 and 2040, each consisting of existing turbines that have not yet reached the assumed 20-year lifetime and newly installed turbines, some of which are located on repowering sites.

##### Realisable Wind Power Potentials in 2030 and 2040 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The results for the projected expansion of wind power installed capacity in Austria under the three ranges Low, Medium, and High are illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2. For the period up to 2024, the historical expansion of wind power in Austria is additionally shown. The period from 2013 to 2023 served as the empirical basis for modelling future expansion rates (Low, Medium, High).

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> At the upper end of the assumed range (“High”), approximately one third of Austria’s technical wind power potential would be realised nationwide by 2040. This highlights that the technically available wind power potential constitutes a sufficiently large reservoir for any realistic expansion pathway over the foreseeable future. Consequently, there remains substantial scope for political decision-making in determining the regions in which wind power expansion should be implemented. 

### Levelized Cost of Energy, Market Value & Impact of Climate Change

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The evaluation of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), market value (MV), and the impact of climate change was carried out as a post‑processing step following the potential assessment. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The indicated LCOE ranges are based on a site‑specific evaluation that incorporates both construction and operating costs, as well as location‑dependent yield characteristics. Assumptions regarding future cost developments rely on technology‑specific learning curves, international cost trends, and adjusted price and financing parameters. The MV assessment is derived from modeled annual and daily feed in profiles and reflects how its market value may evolve within the electricity system.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> By combining cost and system perspectives, the results illustrate how the relationship between generation costs and potential market revenues may change over time. For renewable electricity technologies, this comparison between levelized generation costs and potentially achievable market revenues provides an initial indication of how their economic feasibility may develop under future framework conditions.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The wind power potential assessment is based on current climatic and meteorological conditions. The impact of climate change was evaluated in a supplementary manner by assessing how moderate (mocc) and strong climate change (stcc) scenarios affect the full‑load hours of wind power plants, based on NUTS‑3‑level indicators.
