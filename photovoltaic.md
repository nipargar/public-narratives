# KLIEN Data – Photovoltaic Potential

## Background

<p style="text-align: justify;"/>The photovoltaic (PV) analysis is based on assumptions regarding new building development up to 2040 and on a framework relevant for rating the necessary extent of land use and the viability of land use change. The assessing criterias include characteristic technical, economical and social patterns of 26 different existing land use classes.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/>Three storylines illustrate different pathways for PV deployment:

* <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Low: </b> Ongoing permitting, planning, grid, and supply chain barriers slow expansion. Reduced incentives, limited storage and slow grid development lead to increasing curtailment and lower total yields. PV remains concentrated on buildings using the best suited areas only. Ground-mounted PV is falling short of its area potential resulting in highly efficient and spatial concentrated PV but little total energy yield.

* <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> Medium: </b> Gradual removal of administrative and grid related barriers enables continued growth, mainly on buildings, complemented by increasing ground mounted and multi use installations. Electrification and infrastructure development progress steadily under generally favourable conditions.

* <p style="text-align: justify;"/> <b> High: </b> Most barriers are removed, grid access is widely available, and PV systems are optimised for self consumption and integration. Storage, energy communities and digital energy management enable high flexibility and output, strongly supporting innovation driven expansion while activating the potential area on buildings and open space.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> New and renovated buildings are assumed to be PV optimised in line with EU building regulations and spatial energy planning, with rooftop installations prioritised. Based on projected new built up areas, municipal level PV potentials for new buildings were derived for 2030 and 2040.

## Methodology

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Fundamentally a nationwide, uniform land use assessment is conducted across Austria, which is aggregated into three dimensions: building-integrated PV, ground-mounted PV on sealed surfaces, and ground-mounted PV on unsealed surfaces. PV installations along and on linear technical infrastructure are considered part of ground-mounted PV on sealed surfaces.

#### Assessment of Technical Potentials 

**Buildings (Roof and Façade)**

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The PV electricity yield potential for roofs and facades across the Austrian territory is derived from GIS datasets. Taking into account averaged system efficiencies, which are assumed to improve slightly over time (from 19.0% in the target year 2030 to 20.4% in the target year 2040), a potential electricity yield in kilowatt-hours of alternating current is calculated for each roof type. As technological innovation and cost reductions in electricity generation are expected within the sector, the long-term potential for 2040 includes an expansion of eligible roof areas to those with global irradiation values of at least 550 kWh/m²·a. PV on facades were calculated using the solar radiation on vertical surfaces while taking into account the distant and near shading situation on municipality level.

**Open Land**

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> For the purposes of the calculations, open land areas are classified into 26 land-use categories. To determine PV potential, potentially suitable open land areas were identified and categorized based on available geospatial data. A general distinction is made between area-based and linear land-use structures. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The total land area of Austria is reduced by those areas that cannot be considered suitable for ground-mounted photovoltaic systems. Land-cover classes include contaminated sites, commercial and industrial areas, extraction sites, agricultural land, grassland with and without agricultural use, wasteland, settlement areas, forests including managed forestry, and large public parking areas.

#### Assessment of Realizable Potentials 

**Buildings (Roof and Façade)**

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The technically usable roof and facade areas are reduced by economic and social realisation factors. Potentials on pitched and flat roofs are assessed with slightly different weighting. The building footprint areas expanded in the target years are distributed analogously to the existing proportions of the two roof types. This results in realisable potentials differentiated by three storylines and two target years.


**Open Land**

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Realisable potentials for the target years 2030 and 2040 are determined on the basis of additional, specificparameters and expert assumptions, applying economic and social realization factors in a two-step procedure. Individual usability factors are assigned to different land-cover classes under the respective considerations. 

## Results

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> Figure 1 informs on the status quo (as of 2024) and it summarises the outcomes related to the realisable photovoltaic potentials for the target years 2030 and 2040   in Austria.

### Levelized Cost of Energy, Market Value & Impact of Climate Change

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The evaluation of the levelized cost of energy (LCOE), market value (MV), and the impact of climate change was carried out as a post‑processing step following the assessment of generation potentials

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The specified LCOE ranges are based on a location-specific assessment that takes into account both construction and operating costs as well as site-dependent yield characteristics. For future cost developments, technology-specific assumptions, international cost trends, and adjusted price and financing parameters were used. Market value is based on prospective model-based analysis as undertaken in the recently completed FFG study Marktprämien 2.0 (cf. <a target="_blank" href=" https://www.ait.ac.at/themen/flexibilitaet-geschaeftsmodelle/projekte/marktpraemien-20"> Marktprämien 2.0 </a> - AIT Austrian Institute Of Technology), acknowledging hourly feed-in profiles of PV generation at the aggregated level in Austria. It thus reflects how revenues from selling the produced PV electricity on the Austrian wholesale market may evolve.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The data thus combines cost and system perspectives and shows how the relationship between generation costs and potential market revenues may change over time. For renewable electricity technologies, this comparison of electricity generation costs and potentially achievable market revenues provides an initial assessment of how their economic viability could develop under future conditions in the absence of public funding. It thus indicates the need for financial support as currently provided by the Austrian Renewable Expansion Act.

<p style="text-align: justify;"/> The PV potential assessment is based on current climatic and meteorological conditions. The impact of climate change was evaluated in a supplementary manner by assessing how moderate (mocc) and strong climate change (stcc) scenarios affect the full load hours of wind power systems, based on NUTS 3 level climate impact indicators derived in the recently completed FFG study ROBINE (cf. <a target="_blank" href=" https://www.ait.ac.at/en/themen/energieszenarien-und-energiesystemplanung/robine "> ROBINE</a> Regionsspezifische Impactuntersuchung von Klimawandel für eine robuste und integrale Energieinfrastruktur in Österreich.
